## Install pre-commit

Checks code conventions.

Pre-commit sets up git hooks.  
Once added, any scripts defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
runs upon commit and ensures defined conventions are met.

If they arenâ€™t, files might be automatically fixed
or you might have to fix the detected problems yourself.
After fixing the files, add them to the staged diffs and commit.

* Install python 3.12

  ```
  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa
  sudo apt install python3.12 python3.12-dev

  curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
  python3.12 get-pip.py --force-reinstall
  python3.12 -m pip install --upgrade pip
  ```

* Install pre-commit

  ```
  python3.12 -m pip install pre_commit
  ```

* Add the pre-commit hook to git

  ```
  cd django
  python3.12 -m pre_commit uninstall
  python3.12 -m pre_commit install
  ```

  Note: After a rebase or fixing a conflict, you need to run pre-commit manually

  ```
  python3.12 -m pre_commit run --all-files
  ```
